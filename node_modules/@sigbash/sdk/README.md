# @sigbash/sdk

TypeScript SDK for **Sigbash** — policy-gated oblivious Bitcoin signing.

Sigbash is a co-signing service for Bitcoin transactions. You define a POET
(*Policy Operand Evaluation Tree*) that encodes spending rules, and the Sigbash
server will only co-sign when those rules are satisfied. The server is
*oblivious*: it never sees the transaction content, the co-signers, or which
policy path was taken. It learns only that *some* valid path was satisfied,
proved by a zero-knowledge proof computed inside the WASM module.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sigbash/sdk
```

Works in Node ≥ 16, evergreen browsers, and Electron (auto-detected).

---

## Credentials

No dashboard or sign-up required. Generate a credential triplet locally:

```typescript
import { generateCredentials } from '@sigbash/sdk';

const { apiKey, userKey, userSecretKey } = await generateCredentials();
// Writes .env on first run. Returns existing values on subsequent runs.
```

> **Your credentials never leave your machine.** `generateCredentials()` produces
> three random hex strings locally. Sigbash only ever receives
> `authHash = DSHA256(apiKey ∥ userKey)` — a one-way hash. Your raw credentials
> are never transmitted.

| Credential | Role | Sent to server? |
|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | Organisation identifier | No — only its hash |
| `userKey` | User identifier within your organisation | No — only its hash |
| `userSecretKey` | Local encryption key — protects your key material | **Never** |

Keep `userSecretKey` private. The first user to call `createKey()` in a new org
becomes the admin. Additional users are added by the admin via
`client.registerUser(userKey, newUserPopPubkey)` — the new user's PoP public
key is derived from their `userSecretKey` (call
`SigbashClient.derivePopPublicKey(userSecretKey)`).

> **Signet only by default.** All keys are created on Bitcoin signet. To enable
> mainnet access for your org, email [sales@sigbash.com](mailto:sales@sigbash.com)
> with your `apikeyHash` (import `getAuthHash` from `@sigbash/sdk` and call `getAuthHash(apiKey, userKey)`).

## ⚠️ Back up a recovery kit for every key

**Sigbash cannot recover your keys for you.** The server is oblivious — it never
sees `userSecretKey` and cannot decrypt your key material container (KMC). If
`userSecretKey` is lost and no recovery kit exists, the key — and any funds it
controls — is **permanently inaccessible**.

After every `createKey()`, immediately export a recovery kit and store it
somewhere durable (treat it like a private-key backup):

```typescript
const kit = await client.exportRecoveryKit(keyId);
await mySecureStore.save(`recovery-kit-${keyId}`, JSON.stringify(kit));
```

This applies **doubly to admin accounts**: the first user in an org is the
admin, and losing the admin's credentials without a recovery kit locks the
whole org out of admin operations (user management, 2FA reset, admin-initiated
key recovery for departed users). Export and back up the admin's recovery kits
the moment they are created.

See [docs/recovery.md](docs/recovery.md) for the full recovery flow, and
[docs/admin.md](docs/admin.md#admin-initiated-key-recovery) for admin-initiated
recovery of departed users' keys.

## Quick start

```typescript
import { generateCredentials, loadWasm, SigbashClient, conditionConfigToPoetPolicy } from '@sigbash/sdk';

// 1. Generate (or load) credentials — writes .env on first run
const { apiKey, userKey, userSecretKey } = await generateCredentials();

// 2. Load WASM (once per process)
await loadWasm({ wasmUrl: 'https://www.sigbash.com/sigbash.wasm' });

// 3. Create a client
const client = new SigbashClient({
  serverUrl: 'https://www.sigbash.com',
  apiKey,
  userKey,
  userSecretKey,
});

// 4. Define a policy — all outputs must be <= 10,000 sats
const policy = conditionConfigToPoetPolicy({
  type: 'OUTPUT_VALUE',
  selector: 'ALL',
  operator: 'LTE',
  value: 10_000,
});

// 5. Register a key with the policy
const { keyId, bip328Xpub } = await client.createKey({
  policy,
  network: 'signet',   // signet only by default — email sales@sigbash.com to upgrade
  require2FA: false,
});
// Import this xpub into your descriptor or multisig wallet to fund the key.
console.log('Import this xpub into your wallet:', bip328Xpub);

// 6. Export a recovery kit — REQUIRED. Without this kit, losing userSecretKey
//    means losing access to this key permanently. Sigbash cannot restore it.
const kit = await client.exportRecoveryKit(keyId);
await mySecureStore.save(`recovery-kit-${keyId}`, JSON.stringify(kit));

// 7. Retrieve key material (needed for signing)
const { kmcJSON } = await client.getKey(keyId, { verbose: true });

// 8. Sign a PSBT
const result = await client.signPSBT({
  keyId,
  psbtBase64: '<your base64-encoded PSBT>',
  kmcJSON,
  network: 'signet',
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Signed tx:', result.txHex);
  console.log('Satisfied path:', result.pathId, result.satisfiedClause);
}
```

Fund the wallet by importing `bip328Xpub` into a descriptor wallet (e.g.
`tr(<bip328Xpub>/0/*)` for single-sig) or a multisig coordinator using a
`sortedmulti_a(...)` descriptor. Use the literal xpub here — `bip328Xpub` in
this context is a real value to substitute, not the `SIGBASH_XPUB` placeholder
used inside POET descriptor templates. Don't send funds to `p2trAddress` from
the verbose response — that's a debug artifact, not the spendable wallet root.

## Documentation

Read these in order to go from zero to signing:

1. **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)** — WASM loading, integrity verification, full Node.js walkthrough
2. **[Creating Keys](docs/creating-keys.md)** — policy templates, `conditionConfigToPoetPolicy`, raw POET policies
3. **[Policy Reference](docs/policy-reference.md)** — operators and condition types with examples

Then as needed:

- [Authentication](docs/authentication.md) — three-credential model, KEK derivation
- [Signing a PSBT](docs/signing.md) — `signPSBT` options, TOTP 2FA setup
- [Verifying a PSBT](docs/verifying.md) — dry-run policy checks without consuming a nullifier
- [Stateful Constraints](docs/stateful-constraints.md) — `COUNT_BASED_CONSTRAINT` and `TIME_BASED_CONSTRAINT`
- [Error Handling](docs/error-handling.md) — error class hierarchy and recovery patterns
- [Running the HTTP Server](docs/server.md) — standalone Node.js, Docker, curl examples
