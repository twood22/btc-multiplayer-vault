# Account Recovery

The SDK supports **recovery kit export and import** so that a user who loses their `userSecretKey` can still access their key material container (KMC, the encrypted blob holding your signing keys) and resume signing operations.

> **Lost your `userSecretKey`?** If you have a recovery kit, jump to [Recovering From a Kit](#recovering-from-a-kit). If you don't have a kit, the KMC cannot be recovered — see the [FAQ](#faq).

> Admins can recover a departed user's kit — see [admin.md § Admin-initiated key recovery](admin.md#admin-initiated-key-recovery).

## Background: Why Recovery Is Needed

The SDK derives encryption keys from the credential triplet:

| Credential | Holder | Sent to server? |
|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | Admin | No (only `authHash` is sent) |
| `userKey` | Admin | No (only `authHash` is sent) |
| `userSecretKey` | User only | **Never** |

```
authHash    = DSHA256(apiKey ‖ userKey)        — server authentication
credKEK     = HKDF(triplet, salt='sigbash-kmc-v1', …)
recoveryKEK = HKDF(triplet, salt='sigbash-kmc-v1-user-recovery', …)
```

During `createKey()`, the KMC is encrypted under a fresh CEK, which is itself wrapped under both KEKs:

- **auth slot** → CEK wrapped under `credKEK` (normal access path)
- **`enc_kek2`** → CEK wrapped under `recoveryKEK` (recovery path, stored server-side)

If `userSecretKey` is lost, neither KEK can be re-derived — both the auth slot and the recovery slot become unreachable without the kit. A recovery kit solves this by **pre-deriving and storing** the `recoveryKEK` before the secret is lost.

## Exporting a Recovery Kit

Call `exportRecoveryKit()` while the credential triplet is still valid:

```typescript
const client = new SigbashClient({ apiKey, userKey, userSecretKey, serverUrl });

// Signature: exportRecoveryKit(keyId, opts?: { keyIndex?: number })
// keyIndex defaults to 0 when omitted.
const kit = await client.exportRecoveryKit(keyId);

// Persist the kit securely — treat it like a private key.
await mySecureStore.save('recovery-kit', JSON.stringify(kit));
```

> **Export after every `createKey()`.** Each new key gets a new CEK and a new `enc_kek2`, so each key needs its own recovery kit. Make `exportRecoveryKit()` part of your key-creation workflow.

> **Storage warning.** The kit bundles `apiKey`, `userKey`, and `recoveryKEK` — all three are sensitive when held together, since they are sufficient to authenticate to the server and unwrap the CEK for this `keyId`. Do not commit kits to source control. Treat the file the same as a private key backup.

The returned `SdkRecoveryKit` object looks like:

```json
{
  "version": "sdk-recovery-v1",
  "keyId": "key-abc123",
  "recoveryKEK": "a3f1c8...e8d2",
  "cekCiphertext": "4a7f3e...",
  "cekNonce": "1b2c8f...",
  "network": "mainnet",
  "createdAt": 1745000000,
  "apiKey": "aabbcc...",
  "userKey": "ddeeff...",
  "popSeed": "7c1d8a...4f2e"
}
```

`apiKey` and `userKey` are always present in kits exported by this SDK version; the type marks them optional only for forward/backward compatibility with older kits. Treat them as required when parsing a kit produced here. Their inclusion makes the kit **fully self-contained**: recovering from it does not require a separately stored `.env` file.

`popSeed` is the 32-byte Ed25519 PoP private seed. The server requires every authenticated request to be signed by the registered `pop_pubkey`; bundling the seed in the kit means a recovering client running with a wrong/garbage `userSecretKey` can still pass the per-request signature check. **Treat `popSeed` with the same care as `recoveryKEK`** — it grants the ability to act as this user on the server. 

### Security warning

**`recoveryKEK` is as sensitive as a private key.** Anyone who holds the kit
and has access to the server for the matching `keyId` can decrypt the KMC.

Recommended storage:
- Encrypted secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Hardware security module (HSM)
- Encrypted offline backup (paper printed and physically secured)

## Recovering From a Kit

The `userSecretKey` value does not matter during recovery — it is not used. If the kit includes `apiKey` and `userKey` (all kits exported by this SDK version do), you can reconstruct the client entirely from the kit:

```typescript
const savedKit = JSON.parse(await mySecureStore.load('recovery-kit'));

// apiKey and userKey come from the kit itself — no separate .env needed.
const client = new SigbashClient({
  apiKey:        savedKit.apiKey,
  userKey:       savedKit.userKey,
  userSecretKey: 'placeholder',   // any string; ignored, but the field is required by the constructor
  serverUrl,
});

const result = await client.recoverFromKit(savedKit);
// result is a GetKeyResult — same shape as getKey()

// Use the recovered KMC for signing.
// Prerequisite: loadWasm() must have been called before any signPSBT() call —
// the recovered kmcJSON cannot be used until WASM is loaded in the process.
const signed = await client.signPSBT({
  keyId: result.keyId,
  psbtBase64: '...',
  kmcJSON: result.kmcJSON,
});
```

### What happens internally

1. If the kit contains `popSeed`, the SDK rebinds its in-memory PoP key to the seed before connecting (so the server's per-request signature check accepts the recovering client even though its `userSecretKey` is wrong).
2. The SDK authenticates with the server using `authHash = DSHA256(apiKey ‖ userKey)` plus a fresh Ed25519 signature from the rebound PoP key.
3. The server returns the current encrypted envelope and `enc_kek2`.
4. The kit's `recoveryKEK` hex is decoded to bytes.
5. `unwrapCEK(enc_kek2, recoveryKEKBytes)` → 32-byte CEK.
6. The CEK decrypts the envelope's `ciphertext_package` → KMC.
7. The original PoP key is restored and the recovery socket is disconnected so subsequent calls on the same client revert to the user's own credentials.

## Error Codes

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `NO_ENC_KEK2` | Key was registered before `enc_kek2` support — recovery kit cannot be generated |
| `ENC_KEK2_VERSION_MISMATCH` | The server returned a WebAuthn-type `enc_kek2` blob; use the WebAuthn recovery path instead |
| `RECOVERY_KIT_VERSION_MISMATCH` | Kit `version` field is not `'sdk-recovery-v1'` |
| `RECOVERY_KIT_INVALID` | Kit is missing required fields (`keyId`, `recoveryKEK`, `cekCiphertext`, `cekNonce`) or `recoveryKEK` is not valid hex |
| `CryptoError` | `recoveryKEK` is wrong (the CEK unwrap failed); the kit may be for a different key |

If your key was registered via WebAuthn instead of the SDK credential triplet, recovery uses a different path. (WebAuthn recovery is out of scope for this SDK doc.)

## Credential Rotation After Recovery

After recovering the KMC you may want to re-wrap it under a new `userSecretKey`:

```typescript
// 1. Recover the KMC.
const recovered = await client.recoverFromKit(kit);

// 2. Create a new key with the recovered policy (requires new userSecretKey).
const freshClient = new SigbashClient({ apiKey, userKey, userSecretKey: newSecret, serverUrl });

// 3. Re-register: call createKey() with the same policy to get a new keyId
//    and fresh KMC wrapped under the new credentials.
//    Note: a full re-key (new musig2 key pair) is the safest approach.
```

> **Footgun warning — this is not in-place rotation.** Calling `createKey()` again produces a **new `keyId` and a new on-chain Bitcoin address**. The original address keeps its original keys and policy and is not rewrapped. "Same policy, fresh KMC" means a brand-new key with the same rules — any funds held at the old address must be migrated (spent to the new address) before the old `userSecretKey` is discarded. Plan the migration transaction before rotating credentials.

## FAQ

**Q: Can the server or admin recover the KMC without the recovery kit?**  
No. The server stores `enc_kek2` (CEK encrypted under `recoveryKEK`), but `recoveryKEK` is derived from `userSecretKey` which the server never receives. Without either the full triplet or the pre-derived `recoveryKEK` from the kit, the CEK is unrecoverable.

**Q: What if both `userSecretKey` and the recovery kit are lost?**  
The KMC is permanently inaccessible. There is no server-side recovery mechanism. Export and store recovery kits with the same care as private key backups.

**Q: Does recovering change the on-chain address or policy root?**  
No. Recovery only decrypts the existing KMC — it does not create a new key, modify the policy, or change any on-chain state.
